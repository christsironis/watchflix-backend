00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:05.626
The following digital cinema
has been digitally remastered

00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:08.960
to celebrate its 10th anniversary.

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:03.710
What?

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:09.293
I said I want to tell you my story.

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:10.918
What the hell?

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:13.626
What's with the way
you fucking talk?

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.460
Who the fuck are you?

00:01:26.668 --> 00:01:30.626
My name is

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:38.085
Oh Dae-su.

00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:40.710
Why did you hit on
someone else's girlfriend?

00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:43.251
Hold on.
Did I hit on her?

00:01:43.418 --> 00:01:45.960
- Mr. Oh Due-su!
- Did I hit on her?

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.751
Fuck! Okay! I got it.

00:01:48.918 --> 00:01:51.126
Just a minute.
Okay! Okay!

00:01:51.293 --> 00:01:52.418
Fuck.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.668
Mr. Oh Dae-su
please sit down.

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.210
He is totally drunk.

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:05.501
I hit on her?
Hey, let me piss first.

00:02:05.668 --> 00:02:07.710
I didn't hit on anyone!

00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:11.210
- You son of a bitch!
- This guy is a real headache.

00:02:11.376 --> 00:02:13.085
- Asshole!
- Mr. Oh Dae-su!

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:14.918
Sit down.

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:16.710
I'm very sorry.

00:02:17.543 --> 00:02:20.710
- I gotta piss bad.
- Great.

00:02:20.876 --> 00:02:24.043
- Cute, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Sit down.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.335
Today is
my daughter's birthday.

00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:29.751
I got her
a birthday present.

00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:33.626
Snatches of clouds
float in the sky.

00:02:33.793 --> 00:02:37.418
Ah, great
A pleasure boat floats on the river.

00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:41.293
My name Oh Dae-su means

00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:48.710
"Just get by the day quietly."
That's why I'm Oh Dae-su.

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:50.501
But shit,

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:58.835
why can't I get by this day quietly?
Let me go! Huh!

00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:02.376
- Shut the hell up!
- Let me go!

00:03:20.876 --> 00:03:22.460
Let go of me!

00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:24.835
That guy really needs
some prison time.

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:29.085
- Get away from me!
- Hey, get him!

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.251
I'll make sure he doesn't get drunk
and cause trouble again.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.293
Have a nice day
Officer.

00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:44.251
He's usually a nice guy, but...
Let's go.

00:03:44.418 --> 00:03:46.626
I'll come visit you soon.

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:49.335
No need.
Don't come back.

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:52.043
That's up to me
you assholes.

00:03:52.793 --> 00:03:53.876
Hey!

00:03:56.168 --> 00:04:03.293
My sweet pea, it's daddy.
Daddy got you a present.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.668
I'll be home soon with your gift
so wait a bit longer.

00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:07.751
Let me talk to her.

00:04:07.918 --> 00:04:11.251
- Good girl, good.
- Give me the phone.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.918
Sweet pea, Joo-hwan
wants to talk to you.

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:17.085
You know Joo-hwan, right?
Hold on.

00:04:18.835 --> 00:04:24.585
Hi, sweetie.
It's me, Joo-hwan.

00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:29.376
So today's your birthday?
Happy birthday.

00:04:29.543 --> 00:04:32.043
I'll treat you
to something nice tomorrow.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.751
Hello?
Oh, Ja-hyun, I'm sorry.

00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:40.626
I know it's very late.
Dae-su is on his way now.

00:04:40.793 --> 00:04:43.793
I'm sorry.
Yes? Hold on.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.460
Dae-su, it's your wife.

00:04:51.043 --> 00:04:52.210
Dae-su!

00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:55.335
Dae-su!

00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:01.085
Oh Dae-su!

00:05:03.876 --> 00:05:04.960
Dae-su!

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.043
I really had enough!
Stop fooling around and let's go already.

00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:22.293
Dae-su!

00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:20.626
Sir, sir.

00:06:20.793 --> 00:06:23.835
Wait, come here.
Come talk to me.

00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:27.710
I won't ask you to let me go.

00:06:27.876 --> 00:06:34.710
Just tell me why I'm here, okay?
I should know the reason at least.

00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:40.335
Shit, I've been locked up here
for two months already.

00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:44.710
Sir, wait, come here.
What is this place?

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:49.335
Sir, just tell me how long
I have to stay in here.

00:06:49.501 --> 00:06:50.543
Just tell me that, huh?
Sir!

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.043
Fuck you!

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.960
Come here, you asshole!

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.876
Son of a bitch.

00:07:00.043 --> 00:07:03.293
I saw your face, asshole.
You're dead when I get out.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.751
Come here, asshole.

00:07:04.918 --> 00:07:06.710
I'm sorry. I won't curse.

00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:11.835
Just tell me.
One month, two, or three?

00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:13.960
Hey, where are you going?

00:07:14.126 --> 00:07:18.376
Just tell me how long
you son of a bitch!

00:07:18.543 --> 00:07:22.918
I said tell me how long
you asshole!

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:29.626
You son of a bitch!
Fucking assholes!

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.876
<i>If they had told me
it was going to be 15 years,</i>

00:07:36.751 --> 00:07:39.418
<i>could it have been easier to endure?</i>

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:42.543
<i>Or could it have not?</i>

00:07:43.626 --> 00:07:48.418
<i>“Laugh, and the world laughs with you.
Weep, and you weep alone.“</i>

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.960
<i>When the melody plays gas comes out.</i>

00:08:06.793 --> 00:08:10.543
<i>When the gas comes I fall asleep.</i>

00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:20.335
<i>I found out later
that it's the same Valium gas</i>

00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:24.085
<i>Russian soldiers
used on the Chechen terrorists.</i>

00:08:31.876 --> 00:08:34.626
<i>When I wake up
my hair has been cut.</i>

00:08:34.793 --> 00:08:37.168
<i>I don't like the style really.</i>

00:08:38.043 --> 00:08:43.751
<i>But they change my clothes
and clean the place up.</i>

00:08:44.918 --> 00:08:46.335
<i>Kind bastards.</i>

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.960
<i>One, two,</i>

00:08:55.251 --> 00:08:56.710
<i>three.</i>

00:08:58.626 --> 00:08:59.960
It's too spicy...

00:09:00.126 --> 00:09:02.543
I don't want spinach.
You eat it.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.335
I won't eat spinach.

00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:11.543
<i>Kim Ja-hyun's body was found
deeply stabbed in the neck.</i>

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:15.710
<i>The brutality of the murder
with no valuables missing</i>

00:09:15.876 --> 00:09:19.668
<i>led the police to suspect that
the motive was a personal grudge.</i>

00:09:19.835 --> 00:09:24.585
<i>Her husband who disappeared a year ago
is now on the wanted list.</i>

00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:29.460
<i>According to neighbors
the missing husband, Oh Dae-su,</i>

00:09:29.626 --> 00:09:33.751
<i>drank often, causing trouble
with his wife and the neighbors.</i>

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.043
<i>Blood found at the scene
matched Oh Dae-su's.</i>

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.835
<i>Fresh fingerprints were found
from a cup at the crime scene,</i>

00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:49.501
<i>proving that Oh Dae-su recently visited,
according to the police.</i>

00:09:50.835 --> 00:09:55.543
<i>A missing family album, the only
stolen item also backs their theories.</i>

00:10:28.043 --> 00:10:29.626
<i>After three years</i>

00:10:30.168 --> 00:10:33.751
<i>many wrinkles have formed on his face.</i>

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:40.085
<i>- That is around $61.000
- For a Sushi knife .</i>

00:10:40.251 --> 00:10:43.293
<i>“Right always prevails“</i>

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:51.376
<i>If you stand aimlessly
at a phone booth on a rainy day</i>

00:10:51.543 --> 00:10:55.751
<i>and meet a man whose face
is hidden under a purple umbrella.</i>

00:10:55.918 --> 00:11:01.126
<i>I'd suggest that you get close to the TV.
- "A listening device?"</i>

00:11:01.418 --> 00:11:04.501
<i>The television is both
a clock and a calendar.</i>

00:11:04.668 --> 00:11:08.668
<i>It's your school, home, church,</i>

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.126
<i>friend</i>

00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:12.460
<i>and lover.</i>

00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:14.793
<i>But...</i>

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.501
<i>Countless nights may puss</i>

00:11:19.293 --> 00:11:22.876
<i>But my heart is turned to you</i>

00:11:23.793 --> 00:11:28.085
<i>Though I may shed my sad tears</i>

00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:32.335
<i>It's still your face that I miss</i>

00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:37.960
<i>But...</i>

00:11:38.876 --> 00:11:40.710
<i>my lover's song</i>

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:44.168
<i>is too short.</i>

00:11:51.876 --> 00:11:55.626
<i>This morning around 7:50
the Sungsoo Bridge</i>

00:11:55.793 --> 00:11:58.710
<i>in Seoul suddenly
collapsed in the middle.</i>

00:11:58.876 --> 00:12:04.751
<i>I wrote about all the people
I fought, tormented, and hurt.</i>

00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:11.710
<i>This was both my prison journal</i>

00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:14.626
<i>and an autobiography of my evil deeds.</i>

00:12:16.793 --> 00:12:19.710
<i>I thought I had lived an average life</i>

00:12:23.168 --> 00:12:24.960
<i>but I've sinned so much.</i>

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:35.835
<i>All I could think about
at that moment was</i>

00:12:36.668 --> 00:12:41.460
<i>the poor guy next door is eating
with only one chopstick.</i>

00:12:43.418 --> 00:12:44.501
<i>But...</i>

00:12:46.751 --> 00:12:47.960
<i>But...</i>

00:12:55.918 --> 00:12:57.835
<i>Who locked me up here?</i>

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.335
<i>Yoo Heung-sam?</i>

00:13:01.168 --> 00:13:03.960
<i>Lee So-young or Kang Chang-suk?</i>

00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:07.501
<i>Whoever it was, just wait.</i>

00:13:08.085 --> 00:13:10.085
<i>Wait just a bit.</i>

00:13:10.251 --> 00:13:13.793
<i>From the top of your head
down to the tips of your toes</i>

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.543
<i>no one will be able to find
any trace of your body on this earth.</i>

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.210

<i>For this first time

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.793
<i>It will be easier from next year.</i>

00:13:57.501 --> 00:14:01.501
<i>The more the tattoos
the shorter gets the chopstick.</i>

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:07.751
<i>The shorter gets the chopstick
the bigger gets the hole in the watt.</i>

00:14:09.168 --> 00:14:10.460
<i>Anyway,</i>

00:14:12.043 --> 00:14:14.001

you will turn your head and look down.

You will see
an endless field of green grass.

00:17:39.793 --> 00:17:45.001

Mister,

00:19:33.085 --> 00:19:39.251
even though I'm no better than a beast,

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:47.835
don't I have the right to live, no?

00:19:50.918 --> 00:19:51.960
Mister,

00:19:53.168 --> 00:19:59.793
even though I'm no better than a beast,

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:11.918
don't I have the right to live, no?

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.751
<i>That phone booth alley was right here.</i>

00:20:39.918 --> 00:20:42.376
<i>Now there's an apartment building.</i>

00:20:43.126 --> 00:20:46.876
<i>Still, dumping me on the roof...
He's not the most flexible type.</i>

00:20:48.293 --> 00:20:51.001
I want to tell you my story.

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.210
Die a little later.

00:20:53.376 --> 00:20:54.751
What?

00:21:02.793 --> 00:21:04.626
I see.

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:16.418
Now, I'll tell you my story.

00:21:19.293 --> 00:21:24.085
You see, the reason
why I want to die...

00:21:27.751 --> 00:21:28.876
Mister!

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.543
<i>It's a woman human being.</i>

00:21:52.793 --> 00:21:56.418
That crazy guy took my sunglasses.

00:22:04.501 --> 00:22:08.751
<i>Laugh, and the world laughs with you.</i>

00:22:09.293 --> 00:22:13.335
<i>Weep, and you weep alone.</i>

00:22:18.001 --> 00:22:19.960
<i>My home is gone.</i>

00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:23.335
<i>I can't call my friends or relatives,</i>

00:22:24.043 --> 00:22:27.210
<i>because I'm someone
who's murdered his wife.</i>

00:22:30.251 --> 00:22:32.876
<i>Because I'm a fugitive.</i>

00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:37.418
I swear, man.

00:22:38.376 --> 00:22:40.501
Nah, he'll kick your ass.

00:22:41.085 --> 00:22:43.918
Come on, trust me, man.

00:22:57.751 --> 00:22:59.251
You fucktard!

00:23:11.085 --> 00:23:12.710
<i>Fucktard.</i>

00:23:13.835 --> 00:23:19.751
<i>Never heard that one before.
TV doesn't teach you curse words.</i>

00:23:28.043 --> 00:23:33.835
<i>10 years of imaginary training.
Is it any use in real life?</i>

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.085
<i>It is.</i>

00:23:48.835 --> 00:23:53.960
<i>Striped beakfish. Oplegnathus fasciatus.</i>

00:23:54.126 --> 00:23:57.376
<i>Lives in the warm waters
of coastal reefs.</i>

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.710
<i>Despite its weak reflexes</i>

00:23:59.876 --> 00:24:03.751
<i>it's known to resist
tenaciously when caught.</i>

00:24:03.918 --> 00:24:06.460
<i>In South Kyoung-sang Province
its offspring...</i>

00:24:07.293 --> 00:24:09.460
<i>What's this smell?</i>

00:24:21.876 --> 00:24:25.668
Don't even think about
asking me any questions.

00:24:25.835 --> 00:24:27.835
I don't know a thing.

00:24:45.918 --> 00:24:46.876
Pardon?

00:24:49.293 --> 00:24:53.335
I said I want to eat something alive.

00:24:56.876 --> 00:25:00.293
Oh, right.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.710
Long time no see.

00:25:01.876 --> 00:25:03.751
<i>This is my first time.</i>

00:25:04.626 --> 00:25:05.835
Maybe not?

00:25:06.001 --> 00:25:07.751
<i>But she looks familiar.</i>

00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:14.543
You look very familiar.
Where have we met?

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:19.585
"The Search for the Best Chefs"
Channel 11 Thursdays of 6:30.

00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:23.335
The youngest female
Japanese cuisine chef in Korea.

00:25:23.501 --> 00:25:24.960
Oh that?

00:25:25.585 --> 00:25:28.751
They said the ratings are low
but I guess not.

00:25:28.918 --> 00:25:32.460
Women's hands are warm
so they can't make sushi.

00:25:32.626 --> 00:25:35.501
You sure do know a lot.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.460
Who are you?

00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:57.210
<i>Do you like your clothes?</i>

00:26:03.001 --> 00:26:04.335
Why...

00:26:06.751 --> 00:26:10.335
- Why did you lock me up?
- Who do you think I am?

00:26:12.126 --> 00:26:14.668
- Loo Heung-sam!
- Wrong.

00:26:14.835 --> 00:26:18.501
- Did Lee So-young hire you?
- No, wrong again.

00:26:18.668 --> 00:26:19.960
Lee Jung-vow?

00:26:20.835 --> 00:26:24.043
Kong Chang-sum, Hwang Joo-yeon?

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.043
Kim Na-sung? Park Jin-woo?

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:29.126
Im Duk-yoon? Lee Jae-pyung?
Kuk Su-ran? Who is it?

00:26:29.293 --> 00:26:30.668
Who the hell are you?

00:26:31.001 --> 00:26:32.418
Me?

00:26:32.585 --> 00:26:37.210
I'm sort of a scholar
and my major is you.

00:26:37.835 --> 00:26:43.168
An Oh-Due-su-ologist.
An expert on Oh Dae-su.

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:46.543
Who I am isn't important.
The important thing is why.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.751
Think it over.
Review your whole life.

00:26:51.168 --> 00:26:55.001
School is over, so now
it's time for homework. Right?

00:26:56.835 --> 00:26:58.460
Keep this in mind...

00:26:59.126 --> 00:27:04.793
Be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same.

00:27:05.626 --> 00:27:07.751
Let me ask you one thing.

00:27:08.126 --> 00:27:12.210
You hypnotized me in there
didn't you?

00:27:13.335 --> 00:27:15.793
What was the hypnotic suggestion?

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.793
I miss you.
Hurry and come to me.

00:27:31.001 --> 00:27:33.460
Here you are.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:42.043
It's alive, right?
May I slice it now?

00:28:17.585 --> 00:28:22.501
I must be different from other women.
My hands are very cold.

00:28:23.376 --> 00:28:25.376
<i>What's with her?</i>

00:28:28.918 --> 00:28:31.335
Sir.

00:28:32.835 --> 00:28:36.710
Hold on.
Hey mister, wake up...

00:28:36.876 --> 00:28:38.251
<i>Keep this in mind.</i>

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:47.668
<i>Be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same.</i>

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.376
You're awake?

00:29:05.835 --> 00:29:08.043
Is this true?

00:29:28.751 --> 00:29:31.210
That fever medicine
really works.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.043
You fainted so easy for
someone who exercised so much.

00:29:38.085 --> 00:29:44.793
Lack of sunlight over a long time leads
to deficiencies in vitamins A and E.

00:29:45.876 --> 00:29:49.876
Hence my lack of immunity
against the influenza.

00:29:51.168 --> 00:29:53.668
Do you usually talk that way?

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.085
The bathroom door is broken
and doesn't lock.

00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:13.293
Don't get any ideas.
I could slice you like sashimi.

00:30:15.043 --> 00:30:16.210
What's this?

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.626
Suppositories.

00:30:18.793 --> 00:30:22.543
How else could I feed medicine
to someone who's fainted?

00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:41.043
<i>15 years of imaginary training.
Is it any use in real life?</i>

00:30:48.918 --> 00:30:50.210
<i>It isn't.</i>

00:31:06.335 --> 00:31:08.793
I deserve to die for that.

00:31:12.376 --> 00:31:19.335
I bring you here only to deny you.
I get why you're angry.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.710
I admit it.

00:31:25.126 --> 00:31:31.085
I brought you here
because I like you too, but...

00:31:34.043 --> 00:31:38.918
You don't even know my name.
I'm Mi-do.

00:31:40.001 --> 00:31:47.668
You know...
Later, when I feel I'm ready...

00:31:48.626 --> 00:31:51.710
Then we do it.
Scouts honor.

00:31:52.876 --> 00:31:57.210
That song, "The Face I Miss"
in your journal. That's the sign.

00:31:57.376 --> 00:32:01.960
When I sing it
get yourself ready right away.

00:32:04.293 --> 00:32:11.626
When it actually comes to
the critical moment, I may resist.

00:32:11.793 --> 00:32:14.210
But show no mercy.

00:32:14.376 --> 00:32:17.251
Just give it to me!

00:32:19.793 --> 00:32:23.960
<i>Give it to you?</i>

00:32:30.168 --> 00:32:31.835
The ants...

00:32:32.876 --> 00:32:37.335
Do they still come out?
Do you still feel them?

00:32:38.668 --> 00:32:43.210
When it comes to loneliness
it's always the ants.

00:32:43.376 --> 00:32:46.210
The really lonely people I met

00:32:46.376 --> 00:32:49.835
they all hallucinated ants
even if just for a second.

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:52.335
Come to think about it...

00:32:52.501 --> 00:32:55.793
You know how ants always
move in groups.

00:32:56.376 --> 00:33:01.501
So I suppose the real lonely people
keep imagining ants.

00:33:01.876 --> 00:33:05.085
Of course, I never did myself.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.876
She called from overseas
five or six years ago.

00:34:10.043 --> 00:34:11.793
Asked if her dad showed up.

00:34:12.793 --> 00:34:16.585
She didn't even know that
he killed her mother.

00:34:17.293 --> 00:34:21.543
She must have called us since
she only has few relatives.

00:34:22.168 --> 00:34:24.918
She had lost a lot of her Korean.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.876
Her foster parents are
both doctors or something.

00:34:32.418 --> 00:34:34.376
Anyhow, Miss Reporter,

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:41.918
Dae-su is really
not caught yet?

00:34:45.751 --> 00:34:48.835
Your daughter's address is on the front.

00:34:49.001 --> 00:34:52.126
On the back is a map
to your wife's grave.

00:34:55.585 --> 00:34:56.876
<i>Eva...</i>

00:34:57.501 --> 00:35:00.918
<i>Stockholm... Eva...</i>

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.918
Do you want to call her?

00:35:10.793 --> 00:35:12.460
Want me to call her?

00:35:18.251 --> 00:35:20.501
Want to go to
the grave together?

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.418
<i>No, after I kill that bastard first.</i>

00:35:57.835 --> 00:35:59.751
<i>“Blue Dragon“</i>

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.335
Is if the one?

00:36:03.501 --> 00:36:05.835
<i>I haven't even started chewing.</i>

00:36:07.376 --> 00:36:09.293
<i>“Blue Dragon“</i>

00:36:11.793 --> 00:36:12.751
So?

00:36:14.751 --> 00:36:16.668
Was that the same taste?

00:36:29.501 --> 00:36:32.418
<i>Be it 10 or 100 restaurants
it doesn't matter.</i>

00:36:34.835 --> 00:36:38.210
<i>I can't ever forget the taste
I had for 15 years.</i>

00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:46.626
<i>“Blue Dragon“</i>

00:37:06.126 --> 00:37:11.876
Shall I make you a log-in ID?
Your favorite movie or song?

00:37:13.626 --> 00:37:18.418
I was talking to him...

00:37:18.585 --> 00:37:25.835
<i>"Evergreen: Did you talk to someone?
Princess Sashimi: I was talking to him."</i>

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.835
"The Count of Monte Cristo?"

00:37:31.418 --> 00:37:36.835
There's no one
by that name here.

00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:48.710
<i>"How's life in a bigger prison,
Mr. Oh Dae-su?"</i>

00:37:48.876 --> 00:37:50.293
Who are you?

00:37:53.126 --> 00:37:56.418
"Who are you..."

00:37:57.085 --> 00:37:59.543
<i>“A lonely prince locked up
in a high tower.“</i>

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:00.793
Who is he?

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:10.001
I don't know.
Just someone I chat with sometimes.

00:38:10.168 --> 00:38:11.793
And talk about sushi.

00:38:22.126 --> 00:38:23.501
Where are you going?

00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:32.793
Where are you going?

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.876
I can't trust you.

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.085
<i>"Purple..."</i>

00:38:52.251 --> 00:38:55.085
<i>Purple Blue Dragon</i>

00:38:55.251 --> 00:38:59.126
<i>A dragon that's purple and blue.
What does that mean?</i>

00:39:10.793 --> 00:39:13.918
<i>Why order from so far away?</i>

00:39:14.918 --> 00:39:18.251
<i>We passed five Chinese places
just on the way here.</i>

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:22.793
<i>Feels like my lungs will explode.</i>

00:39:29.793 --> 00:39:34.918
Tell your chef to go easy on the
scallions in the fried dumplings.

00:39:35.835 --> 00:39:36.793
Sure.

00:39:48.001 --> 00:39:50.001
- Set it down and go.
- Okay.

00:40:27.376 --> 00:40:31.418
We can't do it by ourselves if it's
someone protected by bodyguards.

00:40:31.585 --> 00:40:34.376
There are people
who specialize in that.

00:40:34.543 --> 00:40:36.335
You'll have to hire them too.

00:40:36.876 --> 00:40:39.960
We do it by ourselves
only if they are small fries.

00:40:40.918 --> 00:40:45.126
But if it's over six months
we'll bring them in for free.

00:40:45.293 --> 00:40:47.668
Yes, that's right.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.126
Why did you imprison me, you

00:40:58.501 --> 00:41:00.293
fucktard.

00:41:01.835 --> 00:41:09.293
In our 7.5 floor business
we guard client info with our lives.

00:41:26.876 --> 00:41:30.418
I'm going to pay you back
for all 15 years of my life.

00:41:30.793 --> 00:41:34.835
With each one pulled out
you age by one year.

00:41:49.918 --> 00:41:51.210
Stay still.

00:41:59.251 --> 00:42:00.668
Ready to talk?

00:42:22.501 --> 00:42:24.460
I don't know...

00:42:24.626 --> 00:42:27.335
I didn't see his face...

00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:30.293
I recorded the call...

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.251
<i>"Oh Dae-su"</i>

00:42:51.501 --> 00:42:54.293
All AB blood types raise your hands.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.751
Hurry, he lost a lot of blood.

00:44:09.376 --> 00:44:12.126
Damn, look at him.
Is he dead?

00:44:23.251 --> 00:44:25.751
You little piece of shit...

00:44:34.876 --> 00:44:37.001
You piece of shit!

00:44:38.251 --> 00:44:41.335
- Go, motherfucker!
- Get the fuck out!

00:44:55.876 --> 00:44:56.876
Fuckface!

00:44:58.251 --> 00:44:59.835
You fucked up son of a bitch!

00:45:15.043 --> 00:45:17.585
Just kill him
damn asshole.

00:45:26.543 --> 00:45:27.960
Fucking asshole!

00:46:40.126 --> 00:46:44.751
<i>Yet another day
I couldn't get by quietly.</i>

00:46:46.668 --> 00:46:50.960
<i>I've now become a monster.</i>

00:46:52.001 --> 00:46:57.960
<i>When my vengeance is over
could I return to being the old Dae-su?</i>

00:47:02.751 --> 00:47:07.876
Mister, are you alright?
Look at all this blood.

00:47:08.043 --> 00:47:11.918
Mister, what happened to you?

00:47:17.376 --> 00:47:19.418
Saewoon Apartments
in Eung-am, building 8.

00:47:19.585 --> 00:47:21.085
Please take care of him.

00:47:22.376 --> 00:47:25.376
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

00:47:26.126 --> 00:47:28.168
Well, then...

00:47:29.626 --> 00:47:31.168
Farewell, Oh Dae-su.

00:47:35.001 --> 00:47:38.543
<i>Farewell, Oh Dae-su.</i>

00:47:40.376 --> 00:47:44.793
<i>Farewell...</i>

00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:43.585
<i>A bastard you hate
but wouldn't want to kill.</i>

00:48:43.751 --> 00:48:46.585
<i>A bitch you detest
but want more than to kill.</i>

00:48:46.751 --> 00:48:48.626
<i>We'll take care of them.</i>

00:48:49.876 --> 00:48:53.210
<i>Don't they go mad
being locked up for so long?</i>

00:48:53.376 --> 00:48:58.335
<i>If you prefer that he doesn't
we can administer some medication.</i>

00:48:58.501 --> 00:49:00.918
<i>There's this one called
“Risperdal Solution“.</i>

00:49:01.085 --> 00:49:05.793
<i>It's known to be a reliable
treatment for schizophrenia.</i>

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.835
<i>The duration is always the issue.</i>

00:49:09.501 --> 00:49:13.460
<i>- How long are you thinking of...?
- 15 years.</i>

00:49:15.293 --> 00:49:18.918
<i>- Too long?
- What did he do wrong?</i>

00:49:19.543 --> 00:49:21.543
<i>Oh Dae-su, you see,</i>

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.585
<i>talks too much.</i>

00:49:26.835 --> 00:49:28.293
Go to sleep.

00:49:29.001 --> 00:49:33.251
It's about time you visited Joo-hwan's
Internet cafe tomorrow.

00:49:42.668 --> 00:49:44.960
Sit wherever you'd like.

00:49:47.001 --> 00:49:48.085
Joo-hwan.

00:49:59.835 --> 00:50:01.626
<i>Oh Dae-su, you see,</i>

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:04.168
<i>talks too much.</i>

00:50:08.376 --> 00:50:11.126
Have you heard
this voice before?

00:50:11.626 --> 00:50:14.918
Do you know anyone who would
hate me this much?

00:50:21.043 --> 00:50:27.585
I don't know all the 260 names
of your women's husbands.

00:50:37.126 --> 00:50:38.918
<i>"Mi-do (Princess Sashimi)"</i>

00:50:41.418 --> 00:50:45.085
- Who's Mi-do?
- This girl who cries over nothing.

00:50:49.543 --> 00:50:50.543
Joo-hwan.

00:50:53.543 --> 00:50:57.835
Did I really talk that much?

00:51:01.001 --> 00:51:07.418
Doe-su, the way I see it
you should look for the perpetrator

00:51:07.585 --> 00:51:11.043
among those who used to be
in your close proximity.

00:51:12.835 --> 00:51:15.626

Like a gazelle from

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:43.626
Like a bird from
the snare of the fowler

00:51:44.168 --> 00:51:46.293
Free yourself.

00:51:49.543 --> 00:51:51.960
- Close quote.
- Who are you?

00:51:52.126 --> 00:51:54.876
Who are you, you rotten bastard?

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.251
<i>I had decided while I was locked up,</i>

00:51:58.418 --> 00:52:00.960
<i>that I wouldn't trust
anyone if I get out.</i>

00:52:01.126 --> 00:52:03.668
<i>That if I find anyone to be suspicious</i>

00:52:03.835 --> 00:52:07.335
<i>I would create a secret which
only that person and I will know.</i>

00:52:08.001 --> 00:52:12.001
The messenger ID, 'Monster'
is a trap that I made to catch you.

00:52:12.168 --> 00:52:15.793
You bring a complete stronger home.
Who are you?

00:52:25.335 --> 00:52:27.085
Who is Evergreen?

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:38.668
I tracked down that ID, Evergreen,
and found out the personal details.

00:52:38.835 --> 00:52:40.918
- Ready to jot it down?
- Go ahead

00:52:41.376 --> 00:52:45.001
<i>The name is Su Dee-ah.
Ever heard that surname, 'Su'?</i>

00:52:45.168 --> 00:52:47.960
- Address?
- It's in Eung-am.

00:52:48.126 --> 00:52:49.960
Saewoon Apartments
Building 7, unit 407.

00:52:55.126 --> 00:52:59.668
<i>I'm not doing fine
in this life in a bigger prison.</i>

00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:19.668
"Evergreen."

00:53:21.501 --> 00:53:22.918
"Who are you?"

00:53:27.376 --> 00:53:29.501
You were going to
say that, right?

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:35.876
No, you must find out on your own.
Come on, it's a game.

00:53:36.043 --> 00:53:39.960
First, who?
Then, why?

00:53:40.126 --> 00:53:42.418
Once you solve the questions
come see me anytime.

00:53:42.585 --> 00:53:47.335
I'll mark the answers for you.
You have until July 5th.

00:53:48.751 --> 00:53:51.210
Only five days left.

00:53:53.876 --> 00:53:55.251
Too short?

00:53:56.043 --> 00:54:00.918
Do your best. If you pass
I'll kill myself instead of Mi-do.

00:54:03.126 --> 00:54:05.460
That's right, Mi-do.

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:11.335
I'm going to kill every woman
you love until you die.

00:54:13.001 --> 00:54:17.210
You're notorious for not being
able to protect your women.

00:54:23.626 --> 00:54:27.335
Wow, you're strong,
Mr. Monster.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.960
You truly are the monster
of my creation.

00:54:32.876 --> 00:54:37.126
But this way, you won't
ever find out the "why?"

00:54:37.835 --> 00:54:40.376
The question that bugged you
for the last 15 years.

00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:43.918
You don't care anymore?

00:54:52.126 --> 00:54:53.460
Take that seat.

00:55:00.751 --> 00:55:03.293
Ah, the dental torture.

00:55:04.751 --> 00:55:07.501
You won't get enough time
to torture me.

00:55:07.668 --> 00:55:11.418
I have a weak heart
so I have this motor inside.

00:55:11.585 --> 00:55:17.460
When it was put in
do you know what I said to the doctor?

00:55:20.335 --> 00:55:22.293
Doctor Hopkins

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:27.626
gave me a remote control
that can switch the motor off.

00:55:27.793 --> 00:55:30.835
Pardon? Why?

00:55:32.876 --> 00:55:37.960
So I can kill myself easily
any time I want.

00:55:38.126 --> 00:55:40.876
I'll give you a 100 grand more.

00:55:54.418 --> 00:55:57.710
Oh, what a conundrum.

00:55:57.876 --> 00:56:00.543
You wan't to kill me right away,

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:03.710
but you won't find out
why you were locked up.

00:56:04.418 --> 00:56:08.543
You want to torture me but
I say I'll kill myself first.

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:14.335
To get your revenge
or to find out the reason.

00:56:16.001 --> 00:56:19.335
Oh, that is the big question.

00:56:19.501 --> 00:56:22.710
I've been watching you
for 15 years.

00:56:24.793 --> 00:56:30.710
I fared well thanks to you.
I wasn't bored or lonely.

00:56:33.335 --> 00:56:36.960
Seeking revenge is the best cure
for the ones who were hurt.

00:56:37.418 --> 00:56:38.835
Try it.

00:56:40.501 --> 00:56:43.210
The loss of 15 years.

00:56:43.376 --> 00:56:48.293
The pain of losing your wife and child.
All these would go away.

00:56:49.168 --> 00:56:53.418
In other words
vengeance is healthy.

00:56:53.585 --> 00:56:59.168
But what happens after
you've fulfilled your vengeance?

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.918
I bet that hidden pain
will probably come back again.

00:57:06.835 --> 00:57:08.710
"Are you there
Mr. Oh Dae-su?"

00:57:10.668 --> 00:57:14.293
"Mr. Oh Dae-su
long time no see."

00:57:23.168 --> 00:57:27.418
Hasn't she been tied up for too long?
I think you also left the door open.

00:57:40.835 --> 00:57:42.293
Please save me.

00:57:44.668 --> 00:57:46.585
<i>I need saving myself.</i>

00:57:46.751 --> 00:57:49.876
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose.

00:57:56.251 --> 00:57:58.335
This dentist is really good.

00:58:07.001 --> 00:58:10.710
Don't move.

00:58:11.793 --> 00:58:13.043
What's with you?

00:58:21.918 --> 00:58:22.918
Now

00:58:24.168 --> 00:58:25.543
here we go.

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:49.710
You know, they say that
cowardice comes from imagination.

00:58:51.376 --> 00:58:55.335
So try not to imagine.

00:58:55.501 --> 00:58:57.960
It'll make you fucking brave.

00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:01.168
Now, here comes the real thing.

00:59:30.126 --> 00:59:31.168
Yes?

00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:37.293
Well, sir, I do thank you for
telling me about this place,

00:59:38.543 --> 00:59:40.835
but I haven't even started.

00:59:41.835 --> 00:59:42.793
What?

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:57.918
Let's go.

01:00:14.793 --> 01:00:16.376
Let's really go.

01:00:17.001 --> 01:00:18.293
Let's fight.

01:00:21.793 --> 01:00:22.751
Let's fight.

01:00:28.751 --> 01:00:29.668
Tenacious.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:31.210
Your hand.

01:00:32.251 --> 01:00:37.918
I'm going to cut off your hand.
You touched Mi-do's breasts.

01:00:44.085 --> 01:00:46.376
Then what about my tongue?

01:01:02.001 --> 01:01:04.918
You still don't trust me
you rotten bastard?

01:01:08.293 --> 01:01:10.710
I don't think we'll
reach an agreement

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.168
I looked into it

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:15.501
and their reason for not paying
more than 270 million

01:01:15.668 --> 01:01:18.418
wasn't to do with
the evaluation of this building.

01:01:18.585 --> 01:01:21.001
It's likely that their
convertible bonds holders are...

01:01:24.126 --> 01:01:26.710
So I think there won't be a big issue.

01:01:26.876 --> 01:01:33.376
Of course, there's the 25 percent stake
held by their chairman and his relatives.

01:01:40.751 --> 01:01:41.918
Dae-su.

01:01:43.501 --> 01:01:44.460
Yeah.

01:01:47.835 --> 01:01:50.960
Did he really say
that he'll kill me?

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:53.918
Yeah.

01:01:54.793 --> 01:01:57.460
Because I am
a woman you love?

01:02:03.376 --> 01:02:04.751
Dae-su.

01:02:06.585 --> 01:02:07.668
What?

01:02:08.918 --> 01:02:12.085
I wonder where my love is.

01:02:13.501 --> 01:02:16.876
The night is getting lonelier.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.293
<i>The words we spoke with our eyes</i>

01:02:24.918 --> 01:02:28.168
<i>can be felt with these hands</i>

01:02:29.501 --> 01:02:33.043
<i>Countless nights may pass</i>

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:38.043
<i>but my heart is turned to you.</i>

01:02:38.918 --> 01:02:42.918
<i>Though I may shed my sad tears</i>

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:47.960
<i>it's still your face that I miss</i>

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:56.960
They packed up and left in a rental car.

01:02:58.751 --> 01:03:03.251
Mi-do called the restaurant and quit.

01:03:06.876 --> 01:03:09.085
Let's go after this is done.

01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:13.668
You should get some rest today.

01:03:15.585 --> 01:03:20.251
I have insomnia anyway.
"The night is getting lonelier."

01:03:21.168 --> 01:03:25.751
Mr. Han, do you really think

01:03:26.668 --> 01:03:30.335
Mi-do has fallen in love
with Oh Dae-su?

01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:33.085
Already?

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:57.626
Dae-su, it really hurts.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:00.751
But I'm enduring it.

01:04:02.168 --> 01:04:03.751
I want you to know that.

01:04:18.626 --> 01:04:21.626
How did you hold out?
For 15 years?

01:04:22.168 --> 01:04:23.793
There's always a way.

01:04:25.126 --> 01:04:26.626
Do you like it?

01:04:28.668 --> 01:04:33.710
You really like it, right?
I want to be good to you.

01:05:01.918 --> 01:05:04.210
<i>Do not worry about the future.</i>

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:07.835
<i>Don't imagine anything.</i>

01:05:18.668 --> 01:05:22.710
<i>I feel thankful for
all those years in that prison.</i>

01:05:24.585 --> 01:05:29.293
<i>If I was still my old self
would Mi-do have liked me like this?</i>

01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:09.918
<i>The fact that he knew I wanted to
cut off Park's hand means</i>

01:07:10.085 --> 01:07:13.168
<i>he's planted a bug on us.</i>

01:07:13.335 --> 01:07:16.085
<i>He knew where we were by tailing us.</i>

01:07:16.251 --> 01:07:19.293
<i>"I've been bugged.
Please find it."</i>

01:07:20.043 --> 01:07:22.876
<i>Maybe, he let you go,</i>

01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:27.501
<i>because he has fun watching you
run wild seeking revenge.</i>

01:07:28.668 --> 01:07:32.960
<i>Never telling you why,
toying with you forever.</i>

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:36.418
<i>Could that be it?</i>

01:08:55.335 --> 01:08:57.001
I think he went to
America to study.

01:08:58.168 --> 01:08:59.626
Lee Woo-fin?

01:09:00.835 --> 01:09:06.251
Don't know him. Is that his name?
How did you find out?

01:09:06.418 --> 01:09:09.585
Looked through all the yearbooks
and found his face.

01:09:09.751 --> 01:09:11.876
I wouldn't know him just by his name.

01:09:12.043 --> 01:09:14.418
"Scissorhands Hair Salon."

01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:17.168
Got anything else?
Like the school records?

01:09:17.335 --> 01:09:20.335
Do you know Lee Soo-ah?
She was in our year.

01:09:20.501 --> 01:09:25.418
- <i>Lee Soo-ah? She died.</i>
- What class was she in?

01:09:25.585 --> 01:09:29.001
Homeroom two. She was in my class

01:09:29.168 --> 01:09:32.376
next to yours. What about her?

01:09:33.793 --> 01:09:35.876
But why is there

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:43.085
no photo, because she was dead.
How did Soo-ah die?

01:09:43.251 --> 01:09:48.501
That's right, you wouldn't know.
She died after you transferred.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:56.918
She went alone to the Habchun Dam,
fell into the river and drowned.

01:09:59.251 --> 01:10:04.543
A week later they found
her bloated body in the water.

01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:07.001
- What was she like?
- Her?

01:10:07.168 --> 01:10:10.126
She was a total slut.

01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:16.585
Acting like a prude on the outside
but a filthy whore on the inside.

01:10:16.751 --> 01:10:22.835
There was a huge rumor at the school
that she fucked anyone and everyone.

01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:25.668
I should've gotten in there.

01:10:27.293 --> 01:10:34.710
Anyway, her family was super rich.
Her grades were really good, too.

01:10:34.876 --> 01:10:39.126
But the crucial thing was
that she was such a slut.

01:10:39.293 --> 01:10:42.126
This is such an old story.

01:10:42.293 --> 01:10:45.876
Dae-su, I don't remember tfoo well
since it was so long ago.

01:10:46.043 --> 01:10:49.960
But that Soo-ah...
Wait, didn't you also...?

01:11:03.585 --> 01:11:07.335
Hey, what's going on? Joo-hwan!

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:10.835
Joo-hwan
what's happening?

01:11:11.793 --> 01:11:14.876
Joo-hwan!

01:11:15.876 --> 01:11:19.418
Mr. Oh Dae-su?

01:11:20.585 --> 01:11:26.626
My sister wasn't a slut.

01:11:26.793 --> 01:11:29.668
I really want you to know that.

01:11:31.793 --> 01:11:36.668
Because you got rid of all the bugs
I had to come all the way here.

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:38.460
To listen in.

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.293
So, Mr. Roh Joo-hwan

01:11:43.251 --> 01:11:47.335
died because of you. Okay?

01:11:59.418 --> 01:12:04.418
You son of a bitch!
I'm going to kill you!

01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:07.210
I am going to rip you
into little pieces!

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:28.668
Motherfucker!

01:12:49.543 --> 01:12:53.251
We're not open yet.
Please come back in an hour.

01:12:53.793 --> 01:12:58.043
A man who got six gold teeth here
recommended this place.

01:13:06.043 --> 01:13:07.418
Mr. Park?

01:13:08.501 --> 01:13:11.376
I had to move because of you.

01:13:11.543 --> 01:13:12.751
To celebrate

01:13:14.626 --> 01:13:18.751
I bought some new TVs. Do you like it?

01:13:19.793 --> 01:13:23.335
There are so many channels.
Exciting, huh?

01:13:23.501 --> 01:13:25.793
Some of them even
refuse to leave.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:29.835
You lived in a place like this
for 15 years?

01:13:30.001 --> 01:13:32.543
Got used to it after 11 years.

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:37.835
Come on, I don't need money.

01:13:38.001 --> 01:13:40.376
An enemy's enemy is a friend.

01:13:45.793 --> 01:13:48.501
We threw away the hand
because it rotted.

01:13:48.668 --> 01:13:50.751
My wife will be happy...

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:55.418
Damn sons of bitches
I want to kick their asses.

01:13:57.710 --> 01:14:03.501
So why did you bring me here?

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.043
Let me go!

01:14:06.793 --> 01:14:10.710
If I don't return after July 5th
then let her go.

01:14:14.668 --> 01:14:19.668
While I was locked up
I remember someone visiting me.

01:14:19.835 --> 01:14:23.501
- What did that person do?
- Was it three times?

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:28.168
I put a hypnosis-inducing
drug in your water.

01:14:28.335 --> 01:14:29.876
Sodium Barbiturate?

01:14:31.085 --> 01:14:32.626
TV Man knows if all.

01:14:34.793 --> 01:14:36.376
Dae-su!

01:14:45.001 --> 01:14:47.918
<i>“Scissorhands Hair Solon.“</i>

01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:56.126
That's nonsense.

01:14:56.293 --> 01:14:58.501
Even though it was a Catholic school,

01:14:58.668 --> 01:15:01.876
I doubt she killed herself
because of those rumors.

01:15:02.043 --> 01:15:04.501
There probably was
another reason.

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:09.793
Like she got pregnant
or something.

01:15:10.501 --> 01:15:14.626
But I don't think Soo-ah
really was a slut.

01:15:14.793 --> 01:15:17.043
She was such a
neat and tidy girl.

01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:20.710
She wouldn't put out
for just anyone.

01:15:21.126 --> 01:15:26.168
There must have been a guy
she was going out with.

01:15:28.376 --> 01:15:30.126
So who was that guy?

01:15:31.543 --> 01:15:33.960
Well, I wouldn't know.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.001
Choon-shim.
You knew Lee Soo-ah, right?

01:15:51.168 --> 01:15:53.126
Who was her boyfriend?

01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:55.960
Don't know?

01:15:56.126 --> 01:15:57.960
Shut the hell up.

01:15:58.126 --> 01:16:02.085
What would you know
about friendship?

01:16:02.251 --> 01:16:05.626
Shut your trap. Then who'd know?

01:16:06.668 --> 01:16:09.168
Who?
Joo-hwan?

01:16:12.876 --> 01:16:14.085
What?

01:16:16.168 --> 01:16:21.876
Yeah, I know him.
But how would he know?

01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:26.335
Yeah. Really?

01:16:26.501 --> 01:16:29.460
Okay, hang up.
I'll call you in a bit.

01:16:35.293 --> 01:16:41.376
Choon-shim says Joo-hwan
had told her about it.

01:16:41.543 --> 01:16:44.918
And says that
you would know the best.

01:16:58.876 --> 01:17:03.126
<i>Ring, ring, move aside.</i>

01:17:06.376 --> 01:17:12.876
<i>You'll get hurt if you hesitate.</i>

01:17:24.085 --> 01:17:26.251
<i>"Oh Dae-su"</i>

01:17:42.501 --> 01:17:46.626
Look at you. Put it out!

01:17:46.793 --> 01:17:50.835
I'm transferring today to Seoul.

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:55.418
So butt out, Miss Kim.

01:17:55.585 --> 01:17:57.335
You good-for-nothing!

01:18:53.793 --> 01:18:59.835
- You're Oh Dae-su, right?
- And you're Miss...?

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:02.210
I heard you're popular
among the girls.

01:19:03.501 --> 01:19:06.460
You know how rumors are.

01:19:06.626 --> 01:19:10.251
I heard you're really funny.
Say something funny.

01:19:11.501 --> 01:19:16.418
Being stuck with one image
isn't healthy, but...

01:19:26.418 --> 01:19:31.418
There's this father and son.
They went to the public bath...

01:19:31.585 --> 01:19:32.793
See you later.

01:19:56.543 --> 01:20:00.543
<i>"Take Care
Homeroom Three Fuckheads!"</i>

01:20:58.793 --> 01:21:00.918
- Come on.
- Wait.

01:21:03.543 --> 01:21:05.751
- Come here.
- No.

01:21:08.418 --> 01:21:11.335
- Hurry and come here.
- Okay, okay.

01:21:20.001 --> 01:21:21.626
Satisfied?

01:21:22.085 --> 01:21:24.126
- Raise this up.
- No way.

01:21:24.293 --> 01:21:26.626
- Raise it.
- No.

01:21:41.001 --> 01:21:42.168
What?

01:21:50.876 --> 01:21:52.626
It tickles.

01:22:21.626 --> 01:22:23.168
Give it here.

01:22:28.251 --> 01:22:29.751
What are you doing?

01:22:29.918 --> 01:22:32.585
- Let me see.
- See what?

01:22:33.501 --> 01:22:35.918
- Let me see.
- Stop.

01:22:46.168 --> 01:22:47.793
Go away.

01:24:29.626 --> 01:24:32.710
Was it really Soo-ah?
You sure?

01:24:32.876 --> 01:24:34.835
I don't know her name.

01:24:35.001 --> 01:24:40.210
All I know is that she's in your class
and she rides a red bike.

01:24:46.876 --> 01:24:49.835
Have a good trip.
See you in Seoul if I go.

01:24:50.001 --> 01:24:53.501
- Where are you going?
- Going on a date with Choon-shim.

01:24:54.585 --> 01:24:57.376
You're dead meat
if you tell anyone!

01:25:01.835 --> 01:25:03.085
<i>No way.</i>

01:25:04.793 --> 01:25:08.626
<i>You get locked up for 15 years
just for saying that?</i>

01:25:10.835 --> 01:25:12.751
<i>Was that such a big sin?</i>

01:25:15.585 --> 01:25:20.793
<i>Be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same.</i>

01:25:23.876 --> 01:25:26.210
That's what Lee Woo-jin believes.

01:25:27.835 --> 01:25:32.085
Then what's special about
July 5th?

01:25:33.585 --> 01:25:34.751
That's the day

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.751
Lee Soo-ah died.

01:25:45.126 --> 01:25:46.793
It's over then.

01:25:47.335 --> 01:25:53.210
You said it's not about vengeance
but finding out why he locked you up.

01:25:54.418 --> 01:25:58.876
Now we'll run away where
he can never find us, right?

01:26:02.168 --> 01:26:04.460
I can't end it like this.

01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:07.835
Vengeance has now
become a part of me.

01:26:12.793 --> 01:26:15.710
But you don't even know
where he lives.

01:26:16.835 --> 01:26:20.085
<i>Like a gazelle from
the hand of the hunter</i>

01:26:20.251 --> 01:26:23.668
<i>Like a bird from the snare of the fowler</i>

01:26:23.835 --> 01:26:25.418
<i>Free yourself.</i>

01:26:26.001 --> 01:26:31.293
<i>It's from The Proverbs chapter 6 verse 4.
“Proverbs“ is another word for “Maxim“.</i>

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:36.168
<i>And Evergreen said
he lives in a high tower.</i>

01:26:36.335 --> 01:26:41.293
<i>So chapter 6 verse 4
must mean the floor numbers.</i>

01:26:42.626 --> 01:26:46.251
<i>Fourth floor? Sixth floor?</i>

01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:48.876
<i>Or the sixty-fourth floor?</i>

01:26:51.793 --> 01:26:52.876
<i>P?</i>

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:54.751
<i>Penthouse!</i>

01:26:58.043 --> 01:27:00.293
<i>Please press the passcode.</i>

01:27:06.876 --> 01:27:09.585
What would you like me to pray for?

01:27:12.210 --> 01:27:16.043
<i>Wrong entry. Please press again.</i>

01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:25.168
<i>Wrong entry. Please press again.</i>

01:27:25.335 --> 01:27:26.835
"Dear Lord,

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:33.960
please let me meet
a younger man next time."

01:28:24.126 --> 01:28:29.418
Please make Lee Woo-jin
kneel down to Dae-su

01:28:30.376 --> 01:28:33.751
and beg him for mercy.

01:28:47.001 --> 01:28:49.668
You slept with your sister.

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.960
Let's go up and talk.

01:29:25.001 --> 01:29:26.043
Get him!

01:29:49.085 --> 01:29:51.376
Let's talk it out.

01:30:22.043 --> 01:30:23.585
Feels great.

01:30:25.876 --> 01:30:27.460
You slept with your sister.

01:30:27.626 --> 01:30:28.918
So refreshing.

01:30:35.668 --> 01:30:40.960
And I started the rumors.
That's why your sister died.

01:30:48.251 --> 01:30:52.918
Looking through the mirror
reminds me of that day. Same for you?

01:30:53.085 --> 01:30:58.126
How unfair of you to erase my memory
and then to tell me to find it.

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.501
I won, so

01:31:02.793 --> 01:31:04.668
die like you promised.

01:31:04.835 --> 01:31:10.918
You think you couldn't remember that day
because you were hypnotized? Really?

01:31:12.543 --> 01:31:15.668
Do you know the real reason
why you couldn't remember?

01:31:18.876 --> 01:31:20.210
Let me tell you.

01:31:24.335 --> 01:31:25.960
You just forgot.

01:31:26.835 --> 01:31:29.251
Is that a letdown?

01:31:29.418 --> 01:31:32.835
But it's true
you simply forgot.

01:31:33.001 --> 01:31:35.626
Why?
Because it wasn't your business.

01:31:36.751 --> 01:31:41.793
Your rumor grew to the point where
they were saying Soo-ah got pregnant.

01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:46.960
My sister got sucked into that rumor
and in the end, began to believe it.

01:31:47.126 --> 01:31:51.918
Then, her period actually stopped
and her belly began to swell.

01:31:52.085 --> 01:31:53.585
Amazing, isn't it?

01:31:53.751 --> 01:31:57.543
Ever thought about the girl, pregnant
with a child who's also her nephew?

01:31:57.710 --> 01:31:59.293
Understand now?

01:32:00.751 --> 01:32:04.918
Your tongue got my sister pregnant.

01:32:06.751 --> 01:32:09.085
It wasn't Lee Woo-jin's dick.

01:32:10.585 --> 01:32:12.543
It was Oh Dae-su's tongue.

01:32:17.710 --> 01:32:19.585
Is that why you killed your sister?

01:32:20.126 --> 01:32:25.668
I thought about the boy, about to
father a child who's also his nephew.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.293
You were probably afraid.

01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:34.335
Afraid that everyone will find out
once the baby's born.

01:32:35.168 --> 01:32:39.751
When you realized that it was all just
her imagination after you killed her -

01:32:39.918 --> 01:32:42.168
how you must have hated me.

01:32:43.793 --> 01:32:45.085
It's understandable.

01:32:50.251 --> 01:32:55.251
They say Soo-ah died alone at the dam
but who took this photo?

01:32:56.751 --> 01:32:58.710
What about this date, July 5th?

01:33:06.168 --> 01:33:09.335
This is no fun.

01:33:09.501 --> 01:33:15.210
I'll just finish what I was telling you.
Listen carefully. My story is really fun.

01:33:15.376 --> 01:33:18.126
<i>Ever heard of post-hypnotic suggestion?</i>

01:33:18.293 --> 01:33:20.668
<i>You suggest something during hypnosis</i>

01:33:20.835 --> 01:33:23.543
<i>and then it's acted out
in your awakened state.</i>

01:33:24.668 --> 01:33:26.793
Still haven't figured if out?

01:33:32.751 --> 01:33:36.376
You bring a complete stranger home
who are you?

01:33:36.835 --> 01:33:39.210
<i>Who are you, you rotten bastard?</i>

01:33:44.210 --> 01:33:46.960
<i>We hypnotized you both.</i>

01:33:48.293 --> 01:33:51.168
<i>One very fortunate thing
was that you both were</i>

01:33:51.335 --> 01:33:55.001
<i>highly receptive to hypnosis
compared to average people.</i>

01:33:56.126 --> 01:33:57.543
<i>Isn't this fun?</i>

01:33:57.710 --> 01:34:02.460
<i>One word gets you pregnant,
one word gets you in love.</i>

01:34:04.918 --> 01:34:09.001
<i>But no matter how much you two
are receptive to hypnosis</i>

01:34:09.168 --> 01:34:12.460
or no matter how good
a hypnotist Ms. Yoo is,

01:34:12.626 --> 01:34:16.626
getting people to
fall in love isn't easy.

01:34:17.876 --> 01:34:19.668
So do you know what we did?

01:34:19.835 --> 01:34:25.293
- Oh that?
- Your first suggestion, of course,

01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:31.210
was to go to that restaurant
as soon as you were released.

01:34:31.376 --> 01:34:35.710
Next, to react to the specific
melody from the cell phone.

01:34:35.876 --> 01:34:40.501
When you hear the melody
you were to say certain words.

01:34:41.210 --> 01:34:42.626
Who are you?

01:34:44.210 --> 01:34:47.418
Do you like your clothes?

01:34:48.585 --> 01:34:53.835
<i>To the man who says those words
Mi-do was to perform a certain action.</i>

01:34:54.001 --> 01:34:57.960
<i>When she grabs your hand
your reaction was to be, of course...</i>

01:35:01.501 --> 01:35:04.668
Your true mistake was not
failing to find the answer.

01:35:05.668 --> 01:35:11.210
You kept asking the wrong question
so how could you find the right answer?

01:35:11.376 --> 01:35:16.251
It's not
"Why did Lee Woo-jin lock me up?"

01:35:16.418 --> 01:35:19.835
It's "Why did he let me go?"

01:35:20.001 --> 01:35:21.668
Once again,

01:35:22.085 --> 01:35:26.668
why did Lee Woo-jin release
Oh Dae-su after just

01:35:28.001 --> 01:35:29.376
15 years?

01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:34.668
<i>“Laugh, and the world laughs with you.
Weep, and you will weep alone.“</i>

01:39:15.835 --> 01:39:16.793
Mr. Han.

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.585
Mister Han!

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.126
Mi-do...

01:40:16.126 --> 01:40:17.876
Mi-do doesn't know, right?

01:40:22.793 --> 01:40:24.960
Why did you hide her there?

01:40:26.918 --> 01:40:30.335
You thought he'd hate me
because I cut off his hand?

01:40:30.501 --> 01:40:34.251
Didn't you stop to think
maybe it was a trap?

01:40:35.001 --> 01:40:39.001
How can you protect your woman
with that brain of yours?

01:40:39.835 --> 01:40:44.751
I've been secretly protecting Mi-do
since she was three.

01:40:44.918 --> 01:40:47.460
But what about you?

01:40:48.126 --> 01:40:50.085
Mr. Park's hand?

01:40:51.251 --> 01:40:53.126
You imbecile.

01:40:53.876 --> 01:40:57.043
Know that new prison of his?
He said he had to move.

01:40:57.210 --> 01:41:00.793
So I gave him that building
in payment for his hand!

01:41:24.501 --> 01:41:25.793
Dae-su!

01:41:27.793 --> 01:41:31.710
There's a box here.

01:41:31.876 --> 01:41:36.251
It's that some violet box.
He's telling me to open it.

01:41:36.418 --> 01:41:37.460
No!

01:41:38.168 --> 01:41:40.876
No, Mi-do, don't.

01:41:41.043 --> 01:41:43.210
Don't open it no matter what.

01:41:43.376 --> 01:41:45.585
If you open it
something terrible will happen.

01:41:45.751 --> 01:41:49.335
What's in it?
You know, don't you?

01:41:49.501 --> 01:41:52.335
Mi-do. My sweet pea
wait a bit longer.

01:41:52.501 --> 01:41:57.751
I'll be there very soon.

01:41:59.501 --> 01:42:05.585
Can't you come right now?
I'm scared.

01:42:05.751 --> 01:42:07.626
My sweet pea, you can wait for me?

01:42:07.793 --> 01:42:08.751
Yes.

01:42:09.751 --> 01:42:13.085
Good.
Good girl.

01:42:13.251 --> 01:42:17.626
I'll call you very soon, okay?

01:42:32.126 --> 01:42:33.543
I beg you.

01:42:36.710 --> 01:42:38.960
Please don't tell Mi-do.

01:42:40.626 --> 01:42:45.085
What has she done wrong?

01:42:47.210 --> 01:42:50.585
You know it was all my fault.

01:42:52.793 --> 01:42:54.210
I have...

01:42:56.001 --> 01:43:01.210
I have committed a terrible sin
to your sister.

01:43:02.835 --> 01:43:08.168
And I was very wrong to you.

01:43:09.418 --> 01:43:15.210
So please leave Mi-do alone, okay?

01:43:20.085 --> 01:43:25.793
If Mi-do finds out the truth,

01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.126
you asshole,

01:43:28.293 --> 01:43:32.668
from the top of your head
down to the tips of your toes,

01:43:32.835 --> 01:43:38.751
no one will be able to find any trace
of your body on this earth. Why?

01:43:38.918 --> 01:43:42.335
Because I'm going to
chew up every last piece of it.

01:43:44.210 --> 01:43:45.335
Woo-jin!

01:43:46.335 --> 01:43:48.710
Mr. Lee Woo-jin
I made a mistake.

01:43:48.876 --> 01:43:51.793
Please forget what I said.

01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:53.876
Sir! Boss!

01:43:54.376 --> 01:43:55.710
Woo-jin!

01:43:55.876 --> 01:44:00.043
We're Evergreen Old Boys
remember?

01:44:00.835 --> 01:44:07.460
With the energy from the green pine tree,

01:44:09.793 --> 01:44:14.460
the Great Sangnok High...

01:44:17.126 --> 01:44:20.418
I'll do whatever you want.

01:44:20.585 --> 01:44:23.335
I'll do anything.
I beg you.

01:44:23.501 --> 01:44:28.751
Woo-jin, if you want me
to be a dog, I will!

01:44:28.918 --> 01:44:32.418
I'm Woo-jin's dog from now on!

01:44:32.585 --> 01:44:34.376
I'm your puppy!

01:44:39.585 --> 01:44:43.126
Look, I'm wagging my tail.

01:44:43.293 --> 01:44:44.668
I'm a dog.

01:44:44.835 --> 01:44:48.835
I'll guard your house.
I'll be your slave dog.

01:46:56.668 --> 01:46:57.960
The box...

01:47:03.876 --> 01:47:05.460
Just leave it closed.

01:47:16.126 --> 01:47:17.585
Now,

01:47:20.168 --> 01:47:22.751
what joy will I live for?

01:48:27.001 --> 01:48:28.251
<i>Dae-su.</i>

01:48:29.210 --> 01:48:30.751
<i>It really hurts.</i>

01:48:32.335 --> 01:48:34.085
<i>But I'm enduring it.</i>

01:48:35.626 --> 01:48:37.126
<i>I want you to know that.</i>

01:48:52.418 --> 01:48:55.376
<i>How did you hold out? For 15 years?</i>

01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:02.418
My sister and I knew everything
but still loved each other.

01:49:05.543 --> 01:49:08.210
Can you two do the same?

01:49:10.543 --> 01:49:13.085
<i>Dae-su. Do you like it?</i>

01:49:13.251 --> 01:49:15.835
<i>I want to be good to you.</i>

01:49:50.876 --> 01:49:52.043
Soo-ah.

01:50:07.543 --> 01:50:08.751
Woo-jin.

01:50:10.793 --> 01:50:12.835
I know you've been scared.

01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:20.585
So let go of me, okay?

01:50:35.168 --> 01:50:38.918
Remember me, alright?

01:50:46.626 --> 01:50:49.626
I have no regrets.
Do you?

01:51:34.918 --> 01:51:38.668
<i>Up until this point is
the whole story of my adventure.</i>

01:51:38.835 --> 01:51:42.418
<i>Thank you gor listening to
this terrible story to the end.</i>

01:51:43.043 --> 01:51:46.918
<i>I hope you now understand
me sending a letter</i>

01:51:47.085 --> 01:51:53.335
<i>instead of talking to you in person.
This is because I have no tongue.</i>

01:51:53.501 --> 01:51:57.168
To be honest
I have no reason to help you.

01:52:01.918 --> 01:52:03.835
But you see,

01:52:04.793 --> 01:52:07.835
I was touched
by this lust sentence.

01:52:09.001 --> 01:52:13.418
<i>"Even though I'm no better than a beast,</i>

01:52:13.585 --> 01:52:18.460
<i>don't I have the right to live?“</i>

01:52:21.168 --> 01:52:24.710
But the hypnosis may go wrong
and mess up your memories.

01:52:26.085 --> 01:52:27.710
Will that be okay?

01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:50.210
Once you're ready,

01:52:52.335 --> 01:52:54.793
stare at that tree.

01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:16.876
The tree is slowly changing
into a concrete pillar.

01:53:25.210 --> 01:53:29.293
<i>You're now inside
Lee Woo-Jin's penthouse.</i>

01:53:30.293 --> 01:53:32.085
<i>It's a dreary night.</i>

01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:40.001
<i>The sound of your footsteps to the window
echoes through the room.</i>

01:53:54.043 --> 01:53:58.043
<i>When I ring my bell,</i>

01:53:59.085 --> 01:54:02.251
<i>you'll be split into two persons.</i>

01:54:06.126 --> 01:54:10.210
<i>The one who doesn't know the secret
is named "Oh Dae-su."</i>

01:54:10.751 --> 01:54:14.460
<i>The one who keeps the secret
is named "The Monster."</i>

01:54:15.001 --> 01:54:16.876
<i>When I ring my bell again,</i>

01:54:17.043 --> 01:54:20.418
<i>the Monster will turn around
and begin walking.</i>

01:54:25.126 --> 01:54:29.835
<i>With each step he will age by one year.</i>

01:54:30.001 --> 01:54:34.460
<i>When the Monster reaches 70 he will die.</i>

01:54:34.876 --> 01:54:40.335
<i>There's no need to worry.
It will be a very peaceful death.</i>

01:54:47.876 --> 01:54:49.085
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:55:31.876 --> 01:55:33.918
What's wrong?

01:55:34.793 --> 01:55:36.835
Look at you.

01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:07.835
Who were you with?

01:57:03.751 --> 01:57:06.085
I love you,

01:57:06.251 --> 01:57:08.001
Dae-su.
